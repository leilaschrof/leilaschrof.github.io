My GitHub account was created for school-use purposes. 

My repository was created recently and therefore doesn't have any projects on it yet. I used it for an assignment in my class.

I downloaded GitHub Desktop on my latop, then I logged into my GitHub account and cloned my repository from the GitHub Desktop app.
